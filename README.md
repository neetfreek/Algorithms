# AlgorithmsCSharp
This library is project for me to better organise various functionality. Currently includes arrays.

This solution contains two projects:
- `AlgorithmsLibrary.csproj`(.NET Standard 2.0) library contains algorithm functionality organised into folders:
  - `Arrays` contains single-, multi-dimensional and jagged-array functionality.   
  - `Common` contains a Helper.cs class.
- `ConsoleApp.csproj` (.NET Framework 4.71) program to test algorithms with console.
  - `Program.cs` contains test methods for testing AlgorithmLibrary functionality.
